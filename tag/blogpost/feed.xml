    <![CDATA[  <h1 id="kondratieff_cycle_interesting_finds_february_2025">Kondratieff Cycle: Interesting finds February 2025</h1>
<p>I recently came across this very interesting term in a research paper and I was very intrigued by this idea. </p>
<p>Also called supercycles, great surges, long waves, K-waves or the long economic cycles &#40;wikipedia&#41; They are hypothesized cycle-like phenomena in the modern world economy .First cycle with steam engine, cotton in 1800s, second peak triggered by railway/steel in the middle of 19th century. Electrical engineering and chemistry triggered another peak in early 20th century. Mid 20th century had petrochemicals and automobiles, late 20th cnetury was triggered by IT? Computers?</p>
<p>Are we in the next peak of Kondratieff Cycle? What is the driving factor of this wave? Is it AI? or Is it the information age? I recently was reading Harari&#39;s latest book, Nexus. In the book Harari argues that our world has evolved around what he called Information Networks. It started from the time when we were able to generate written documents. We were able to transfer information across generations and it provided a push for homo Sapiens. </p>
<p>It then lead to bureaucracy, a very involved hellish information network that humans have somehow managed to create and which leads to the corrupt few taking advantage and leads to the &#39;Musaddilals&#39; struggle around. We are in a different age of information networks. With AI boom that we are currently in, the internet and digital age has transformed our world beyond any. Information is abound in excess, corporates like Meta, Microsoft, X among others own mountains of data. These binary digits stored in various data centers across the world include all the tweets you have made, all the cat memes people have ever created, every bank transfer you have made, all the links you have clicked, all the text you have typed on the internet and your friends and family. We are a commodity. Why am I talking about this on a post about this economic cycle?  </p>
