        <p>
          The Jain-Krishna model is one of the most elementary adaptive network models.
          It captures important aspects of evolution, ecology, financial
          markets and social networks. Depending on the context, imagine a set of items like
          biological species, companies, banks or even political entities. They
          engage in catalytic relations, one species profiting from
          another without harming or depleting each other.
          The factor that determines the growth of an item turns
          out to be its centrality in the catalytic network. Items that profit
          the least from the network are removed and replaced by new species,
          which form catalytic ties at random with the existing species. In the
          course of the dynamics self-sustaining structures emerge, i.e.
          autocatalytic sets. More and more items join them, while those that do not die out.
          At some point the entire network
          consists of one large autocatalytic set and items start to be removed
          even from within it. These stable phases will end inevitably and quite abruptly
          when a keystone item is removed, i.e. that one that is crucial to the
          autocatalytic set but not very central to the network.
