Physicsing â€“ Singing the tune of the universe

> Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas. _(Albert Einstein)_

> Our minds are finite, and yet even in those circumstances of finitude, we are surrounded by possibilities that are infinite, and the purpose of human life is to grasp as much as we can out of that infinitude. _(Alfred North Whitehead)_
