Physicsing â€“ Singing the tune of the universe

> Pure mathematics is, in its way, the poetry of logical ideas. _(Albert Einstein)_

> Our minds are finite, and yet even in those circumstances of finitude, we are surrounded by possibilities that are infinite, and the purpose of human life is to grasp as much as we can out of that infinitude. _(Alfred North Whitehead)_

# My Blog

Here is my Personal Blog that I will update with things I learn as I go through my PhD and with my thoughts occasionally.

* [`Network Science 101 Part 1`](/Blog/network/NetworkScience101/)
* [`Archive from the old blog`](/Old_blog/old_archive/) Old posts archived from old Blog. Need Some refinement.

# Simulations

I love performing simulations!


* [`Agent Based Modelling for Covid 19`](/ABM/) : An agtent based model studying Disease Prevention Measures within Heterogeneous Communities and Studying Effect of Migration and lockdowns. 
* Most of my simulations are on github in private repositories. Need to work on publicly making them available. They will be posted here.
