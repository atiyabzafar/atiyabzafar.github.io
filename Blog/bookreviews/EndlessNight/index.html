This one is not a Poirot story. It&#39;s a standalone Christie book about a &quot;poor rich&quot; girl Ellie and a &quot;penniless&quot; Michael Rogers. Michael our protagonist of the story is the adventurous kind of guy. He never stays at one job. He is someone who cannot &#39;settle&#39; in his life.</p> <p>And yet on one fateful day when he meets Ellie outside an old mansion colloquially known as Gypsy&#39;s Acre. He decides that&#39;s where his future lies. He decides to build his dream house and settle with the love of his life Ellie. An old woman &#40;gypsy&#41; warns them of an ancient evil curse that is set upon the land. They ignore the lady and get married and move into the Gypsy Acre. What follows is a twisted tale of Greed with power hungry relatives sweeping in for Ellie&#39;s money and a lovely Greta.</p> <figure style="text-align:center;"> <img src="/Blog/bookreviews/images/EndlessNight.jpeg" style="padding:0; width:60%;border: 1px solid red;" alt=" Endless Night by Agatha Christie"/> <figcaption> Endless Night by Agatha Christie</figcaption> </figure> <p>This one has been a lesson in patience for me. Endless Night has been lying with me for years. I tried picking it up a few years ago and i was not able to get into it. Then I saw it as the book recommendation for November and i realised this is the time to read it. But then again I found it difficult to pick up. Not because the prose was difficult. But because of certain life events that troubled me. But when the story got picked up a hundred or so pages in. This gripped me. Took me to a tour of the human mind. A messed up mind.</p> <p>Endless Night truly has one of my favourite twists in a Christie book. Almost as good as the twist in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd&#33; And a seasoned Christie reader would know how perfect that was. I loved this book. As the year comes to an end. I am proud of myself having accomplished this challenge. And with only one book to go. I hope to end this year on a good note. :&#41;</p> <blockquote> <p>&quot;Some are born of sweet Delights Some are born of endless night&quot;</p> </blockquote> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Atiyab Zafar.
